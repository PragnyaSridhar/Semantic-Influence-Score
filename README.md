# Semantic-Influence-Score
On a network of influential papers obtained through vigorous filtering, topics were obtained via topic modelling. Semantic similarity between the papers and their derivative works was computed using their references. A strong semantic similarity (in the range of 0.9 to 24) was observed between these articles. Together with the reference intersection, semantic topic similarity gives us a credible corpora of articles to study scholarly influence of base papers on their 'derivative works network'. These networks, which we term as Semantic Influence Networks, and not the traditional citation networks, are the building blocks for analyzing and quantifying article influence, SIS, via a novel application of the Heat Diffusion Model for the influence score. Our final corpora, carefully filtered, is a sample of 1258 articles with 307696 total citations, an average citation of 244, and median citation of 151. The maximum citation of one article stands at 12871 and the minimum at 100 (due to applied filter).

## Set up
Download Aminer.json(DBLP-Citation-network V12) from https://www.aminer.cn/citation

Directories have been named in order of tasks carried out<br>
1_Filter dataset<br>
- filter.ipynb - read Aminer.json line by line using python generator and filter required rows<br>
  <br>

- tagging.ipynb - use 'fields of study' to tag articles with classes Machine Learning, Metaheuristic Optimization and Deep Learning using SciBERT<br>
- dbscan.ipynb - use dbscan clustering to hierarchically tag articles<br>
- tagged_Aminer_dataset.csv - filtered Aminer dataset with tags<br>
- test_ijcnn.csv - used to test SciBERT model as IJCNN predominantly accepts ML papers only<br>

- semantic_score.ipynb - compute semantic score using influence and similarity scores<br>
- venue_prestige.csv - contains the h5 and normalized h5 indices of venues of base papers<br>
- venue_prestige.ipynb - make dataset containing details about venue - name, type(journal/conference), h5 index<br>
<br>
7_Result analysis<br>
- regression&distribution.ipynb - check if regression between SIS and raw citation possible, find distribution SIS belongs to<br>
<br>
final_dataset.csv - complete dataset with tags, complete network details, similarity, influence and semantic scores<br>
<br>
## Results
- SIS is not lineraly dependent on Raw citations (Best fit line does not exist)<br>
- Correlation between SIS and raw citation is scant (Confidence interval of Pearson correlation coefficient)<br>
- SIS does NOT follow Pareto and Power Law distribution (KS test)<br>
